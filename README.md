# NLP-stuff
This is  X-Oppenheimer-X's unofficial repository solely for Natural Language Processing.Here I upload all the python scripts/notebooks I have coded* for the purpose of self training/teaching the basics of Natural Language processing.In coming future,I might add some cool projects in this very repository for the sake of ubiquity.

*- The code I have written might not be my orignal work and in that case I have given the orignal author their deserving credit in the script itself.
